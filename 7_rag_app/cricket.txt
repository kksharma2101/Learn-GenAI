The leather sphere, a crimson gleam,
Awaiting fate, a silent dream.
The willow waits, a polished grace,
To send it soaring through the space.

The bowler runs, a rhythmic stride,
With eyes of hawk, where secrets hide.
He hurls the ball, a twisting dart,
To break the stumps and pierce the heart.

The batsman stands, a watchful gaze,
A fortress built through sun-drenched days.
He reads the flight, the subtle spin,
And chooses where the game to win.

A crack! The sound, a thrilling chime,
A moment etched in space and time.
The ball takes flight, a graceful arc,
A fleeting glimpse, a shining mark.

The fielders leap, with daring hand,
To snatch a catch, across the land.
The crowd erupts, a roaring wave,
For heroes bold and battles brave.

From village green to stadium grand,
The spirit lives, across the land.
Of leather, willow, sweat, and strife,
The timeless dance of cricket life.

Through summer sun and winter rain,
The passion burns, again, again.
A game of skill, a test of will,
On hallowed turf, the story still,

Unfolds each day, with bat and ball,
A captivating, grand enthrall.
So let the cheers and anthems rise,
For cricket's magic in our eyes.
